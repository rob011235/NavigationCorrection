# Navigation Correction
This repo provides code being used by me to perform navigation correction for an mBot Mega Robot I have.

The manufacturer site for the robot can be found here: https://www.makeblock.com/pages/mbot-mega-smart-remote-control-robot

This code is for a an Adafruit Feather Sense: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4516?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAloavBhBOEiwAbtAJO2kXXAh9rT0pNFw7d9zaMO8ZZBGPyhDAFatkPBTjrlgNb1hDGVmJYxoCZg0QAvD_BwE

Currently I have completed the code necessary to get a heading and proximity detection.

A demo of this can be seen here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tg9kj7evsqptutnca0loc/storageemulated0DCIM.convert_security_files1709350313591.mp4?rlkey=3k8bgcl141g9qnf3dfiintjmt&dl=0

An explanaition of how this will eventually be used can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t5n0y21wjkioz5vkwpiez/storageemulated0DCIM.convert_security_files1709350317611.mp4?rlkey=5qki50m5flrnpykfexoumgf53&dl=0
